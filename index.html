            The widespread adoption of Deep Neural Networks
            (DNNs) in important domains raises questions about the trustworthiness of DNN outputs. Even a highly accurate DNN will
            make mistakes some of the time, and in settings like self-driving
            vehicles these mistakes must be quickly detected and properly
            dealt with in deployment.
            Just as our community has developed effective techniques and
            mechanisms to monitor and check programmed components, we
            believe it is now necessary to do the same for DNNs. In this paper
            we present DNN self-checking as a process by which internal
            DNN layer features are used to check DNN predictions. We
            detail SelfChecker, a self-checking system that monitors DNN
            outputs and triggers an alarm if the internal layer features of
            the model are inconsistent with the final prediction. SelfChecker
            also provides advice in the form of an alternative prediction.
            We evaluated SelfChecker on four popular image datasets
            and three DNN models and found that SelfChecker triggers
            correct alarms on 60.56% of wrong DNN predictions, and false
            alarms on 2.04% of correct DNN predictions. This is a substantial improvement over prior work (SELFORACLE, DISSECTOR,
            and ConfidNet). In experiments with self-driving car scenarios,
            SelfChecker triggers more correct alarms than SELFORACLE for
            two DNN models (DAVE-2 and Chauffeur) with comparable false
            alarms. Our implementation is available as open source.

            Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown promising results in modeling
            graph-structured data. However, they have difficulty with processing digraphs
            because of two reasons: 1) transforming directed to undirected graph to guarantee
            the symmetry of graph Laplacian is not reasonable since it not only misleads
            message passing scheme to aggregate incorrect weights but also deprives the unique
            characteristics of digraph structure; 2) due to the fixed receptive field in each layer,
            GCNs fail to obtain multi-scale features that can boost their performance. In this
            paper, we theoretically extend spectral-based graph convolution to digraphs and
            derive a simplified form using personalized PageRank. Specifically, we present
            the Digraph Inception Convolutional Networks (DiGCN) which utilizes digraph
            convolution and k
            th-order proximity to achieve larger receptive fields and learn
            multi-scale features in digraphs. We empirically show that DiGCN can encode
            more structural information from digraphs than GCNs and help achieve better
            performance when generalized to other models. Moreover, experiments on various
            benchmarks demonstrate its superiority against the state-of-the-art methods.

            Since its introduction in 2003, the influence maximization (IM) problem has drawn significant research attention in the literature. The aim of IM is to select a set of k users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. A large number of approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep learning models to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called DISCO that incorporates network embedding and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that DISCO achieves the best performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-art classical solutions. Besides, we also show that the learning model exhibits good generality.
